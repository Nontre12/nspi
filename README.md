# NSPi (WIP)

[![Build package](https://github.com/Nontre12/nspi/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nontre12/nspi/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**NSPi** is a work in progress Switch package downloader homebrew. Inspired by the PSVITA PKGi hombrew made by [@mmozeiko](https://github.com/mmozeiko) and PSP/PS3 ports by [@bucanero](https://github.com/bucanero).

The `nspi` homebrew app allows to download packages directly on your Switch
